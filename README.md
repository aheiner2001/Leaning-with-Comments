# 🧠 Learning Through Code — Project Repository

Welcome to my learning repository!


website URl :

https://aheiner2001.github.io/Leaning-with-Comments/

This is a personal space where I’ll be building various small projects as I learn. Many of these projects are created while I’m still figuring things out, so **I’ll be using comments extensively** to document my thought process, describe what I’m trying to do, and explain the steps I took to solve each problem.

## 📘 What This Repository Is About

- ✍️ **Learning in Public**  
  Each project serves as a sandbox for learning. I don’t always know what I’m doing at first—and that’s the point! I’ll try to leave helpful comments throughout the code that explain:
  - What I’m trying to achieve
  - What I don’t understand yet
  - How I ended up solving (or working around) an issue

- 🧩 **Mini Projects**  
  You’ll find a variety of projects here—anything from simple apps like quizzes or to-do lists to small experiments in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or PHP.

- 🔗 **Linked Learning Pages**  
  Some repositories will include links to related "How do you do this?" pages. These are meant to quickly explain a concept and point to an example in this repo where it’s used in action.
