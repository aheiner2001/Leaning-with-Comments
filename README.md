Project Ideas
Your instinct to adapt your learning approach is spot-on. AI changes how we learn programming, but it doesn't eliminate the need to understand fundamentals - it just shifts what and how you focus on learning.
You absolutely should still learn programming deeply. Here's why: AI tools are incredibly powerful code generators, but they can't make architectural decisions, debug complex systems, or understand business requirements the way a skilled developer can. Think of AI as an extremely capable junior developer who can write clean code but needs direction and oversight.
Your project + commenting approach is actually brilliant. Here's how to make it even more effective:
Generate projects with AI, then force yourself to explain every line in comments. When you can't explain something, that's your learning target. Research that concept until you truly understand it. This helps you build the mental models that separate good developers from code copiers.
Focus your learning on what AI can't easily do:

System design and architecture decisions
Debugging complex, multi-system issues
Understanding performance implications and trade-offs
Code review and quality assessment
Translating vague business requirements into technical specifications
Understanding when and why to use different approaches

A practical learning framework:

Use AI to build projects slightly above your current level
Study the generated code until you understand every piece
Modify and extend the projects without AI help
Break things intentionally, then fix them to understand failure modes
Rewrite parts of the AI-generated code in different ways to understand alternatives

The goal isn't to compete with AI at code generation - it's to become the kind of developer who can effectively direct AI tools and make high-level technical decisions. That requires deep understanding, not just implementation skills.


**Rubix Cube** 
-comments trying to understand the code
- add code snippets to explain how it would work in python and then have a 3 d rubic cube that i can move
